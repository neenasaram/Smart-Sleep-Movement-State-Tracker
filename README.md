# Smart-Sleep-Movement-State-Tracker
### Project Overview
SleepSense is a machine learning-powered project that tracks and classifies sleep statesâ€”onset, wakeup, and noneâ€”using accelerometer data. It utilizes Random Forest, PCA, and ENMO (Euclidean Norm Minus One) calculations to analyze and predict sleep phases based on movement.
### Key Features
+ Real-time prediction of sleep states using wearable sensor data.
+ Random Forest Classifier for accurate and interpretable results.
+ Dimensionality Reduction using PCA for improved model performance.
+ ENMO calculation to quantify physical activity level from accelerometer signals.
+ Deployed with Streamlit for easy interaction and visualization.
### Technologies Used
+ Python
+ Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
+ Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for EDA)
+ Streamlit (for UI)
+ Jupyter Notebook
+ CSV Accelerometer Data

### Web App

### How It Works
+ Preprocessing: Data is cleaned, normalized, and missing values handled.
+ ENMO Calculation: Used to detect intensity of movement.
+ Feature Engineering: Important statistical features extracted.
+ Dimensionality Reduction: PCA is applied to reduce noise.
+ Classification: Random Forest Classifier is trained on labeled data.
+ Deployment: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit allows users to upload data and view predictions interactively.
